# Hadoop Ethereum Analysis

Analysis of Ethereum Transactions

## Dataset overview

Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform where users may exchange currency (Ether), provide or purchase services (smart contracts), mint their own coinage (tokens), as well as other applications. The Ethereum network is fully decentralised, managed by public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process/verify transactions.

Whilst you would normally need a CLI tool such as GETH to access the Ethereum blockchain, recent tools allow scraping all block/transactions and dump these to csv's to be processed in bulk; notably Ethereum-ETL. These dumps are uploaded daily into a repository on Google BigQuery. We have used this source as the dataset for this coursework.

A subset of the data available on BigQuery is provided at the HDFS folder /data/ethereum. The blocks, contracts and transactions tables have been pulled down and been stripped of unneeded fields to reduce their size. We have also downloaded a set of scams, both active and inactive, run on the Ethereum network via etherscamDB which is available on HDFS at /data/ethereum/scams.json.

## Assignment
Write a set of Map/Reduce (or Spark) jobs that process the given input and generate the data required to answer the following questions:

### Part A. Time Analysis (20%)
Create a bar plot showing the number of transactions occurring every month between the start and end of the dataset.
Create a bar plot showing the average value of transaction in each month between the start and end of the dataset.

Note: As the dataset spans multiple years and you are aggregating together all transactions in the same month, make sure to include the year in your analysis.
Note: Once the raw results have been processed within Hadoop/Spark you may create your bar plot in any software of your choice (excel, python, R, etc.)


### Part B. Top Ten Most Popular Services (20%)
Evaluate the top 10 smart contracts by total Ether received. An outline of the subtasks required to extract this information is provided below, focusing on a MRJob based approach. This is, however, only one possibility, with several other viable ways of completing this assignment.

Job 1 - Initial Aggregation
To workout which services are the most popular, you will first have to aggregate transactions to see how much each address within the user space has been involved in. You will want to aggregate value for addresses in the to_address field. This will be similar to the wordcount that we saw in Lab 1 and Lab 2.

Job 2 - Joining transactions/contracts and filtering
Once you have obtained this aggregate of the transactions, the next step is to perform a repartition join between this aggregate and contracts (example here). You will want to join the to_address field from the output of Job 1 with the address field of contracts

Secondly, in the reducer, if the address for a given aggregate from Job 1 was not present within contracts this should be filtered out as it is a user address and not a smart contract.

Job 3 - Top Ten
Finally, the third job will take as input the now filtered address aggregates and sort these via a top ten reducer, utilising what you have learned from lab 4.

### Part C. Top Ten Most Active Miners (10%)
Evaluate the top 10 miners by the size of the blocks mined. This is simpler as it does not require a join. You will first have to aggregate blocks to see how much each miner has been involved in. You will want to aggregate size for addresses in the miner field. This will be similar to the wordcount that we saw in Lab 1 and Lab 2. You can add each value from the reducer to a list and then sort the list to obtain the most active miners.


### Part D. Data exploration (50%)

The final part of the coursework requires you to explore the data and perform some analysis of your choosing. These tasks may be completed in either MRJob or Spark, and you may make use of Spark libraries such as MLlib (for machine learning) and GraphX for graphy analysis. Below are some suggested ideas for analysis which could be undertaken, along with an expected grade for completing it to a good standard. You may attempt several of these tasks or undertake your own. However, it is recommended to discuss ideas with Joseph before commencing with them.
Scam Analysis

Popular Scams: Utilising the provided scam dataset, what is the most lucrative form of scam? How does this change throughout time, and does this correlate with certain known scams going offline/inactive? (15/50)

Machine learning Price Forecasting: Find a dataset online for the price of ethereum from its inception till now. Utilising Spark mllib build a price forecasting model trained on this, the coursework dataset and any other useful information sources you can find. How accurate can you get your forecast within the coursework window to June 2019? How far past June 2019 does your forecast remain accurate? (20-25/50)

Miscellaneous Analysis:
Q) Fork the Chain: There have been several forks of Ethereum in the past. Identify one or more of these and see what effect it had on price and general usage. For example, did a price surge/plummet occur and who profited most from this? (10/50)

Q) Gas Guzzlers: For any transaction on Ethereum a user must supply gas. How has gas price changed over time? Have contracts become more complicated, requiring more gas, or less so? How does this correlate with your results seen within Part B. (10/50)
